# My very first Web Page

Welcome!

The deployed live project can be found at the following link: [no link to provide for this project]

## What does the project do?

The project of several pages of hyperlinks and logos, provides links to wikipedia pages about a variety of programming languages and technologies. 

## What technologies have been used?

The project mainly uses HTML5 and CSS in the construction and design of the pages.
The project was built in Cloud9 on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.
GitHub has been used to store backups of the files.

## Additional features I'd like to add

I would like to make the logos clickable as well as the text name of the technoloogy.
To organise the pages better I would like to have only a single instance of each technology featured on the site and show them in alphabetical order across the pages. The navigation through the site could then also help the user find a link to the technology they are interested in by showing categories of letters, e.g. "Stream One: A-G", or perhaps even dispense with the references to "Streams" as this would make the site more appealing to all users.
